# deleteColumnsToSort

Hamza Shah

This program is designed to take a series of strings from an array and compare the characters that are on the same level as it. For example, an array of {"abc,"def"}, would compare a to d, b to e, and c to f. We will then check if these compared tokens are in sorted order, that being alphabetical. If there is no order, it will return the location of the clumns that are not in sorted order. If they are in sorted order, it will return an empty list. 

Run time: O(n^2) as there are nested for loops
Space Complexity:O(1) as we create one array
